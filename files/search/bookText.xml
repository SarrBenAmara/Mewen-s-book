       This book is a special creation by Mewen Eechout, a talented Year 7 student who

         poured his creativity into both writing and illustrating this story. Covering the


         themes of Living Things and Sport Aim, Mewen's work showcases not only his


                            imagination but also his dedication to storytelling.

         This book is the result of a class competition I organized to inspire students to


        express themselves through stories. Mewen's outstanding effort earned him the


           winning title, and as his teacher, I wanted to celebrate his achievement in a

             meaningful way. That's why I created this ebook—to keep him engaged,


                      motivated, and encouraged to explore his creativity further.


          This book is dedicated to young readers, proving that great stories can come

        from anyone, at any age. Mewen's work is not just a story; it is a piece of art,


                                       filled with passion and originality.





                Enjoy the journey through the pages of this wonderful creation!

        Mewen wants to go home. But the Jungle looks like a giant maze!

        So the friends split into two teams:


        team 1: Mewen + Ibrahim.

        team 2: Ahmed, Taher.


        One team goes to the right, the other team to the left.
